:question and help!?

Hi, I haven’t succeeded at making my about page responsive. 
And the coding att the about page feels wrong as well but when 
I didn’t get it to work I just built it this way that I knew 
and thought would work and it did. But please give me som 
feedback on the coding on the about page and also how a can 
get it responsive. I’m sending in this homework like this 
because it said that it was only suppose to ba a homepage, 
and that I do have!:)
Kindest regards Ebba!
